Create a Docker image and upload it to Docker Hub:
Build a Docker image:
```
docker build -t your-dockerhub-username/sentry-golang-benchmark:1 .
```

Upload the image to Docker Hub:
```
docker push your-dockerhub-username/sentry-golang-benchmark:1
```

Creating Kubernetes Secret:
Replace your-base64-encoded-sentry-dsn with your base64 encoded DSN:
```
echo -n "your-sentry-dsn" | base64 -w0
```

Apply Secret:
```
kubectl apply -f sentry-dsn.yaml
```

Deployment to Kubernetes:
Apply Deployment:
```
kubectl apply -f sentry-benchmark.yaml
```

Notes:
Make sure you replace “your-sentry-dsn” with your real DSN.
Replace “your-dockerhub-username” with your real Docker Hub username.
Make sure you have access to your Kubernetes cluster configured and kubectl installed.
This code will allow you to generate a large number of different exceptions and send them to Sentry, as well as deploy this process to Kubernetes.
